# Music Time Warp
This is an API project using data from The Echo Nest to display bands on a Google map as geolocated pins based on date and location.

## Using the app

* Users can select a decade from the drop down list which will display bands from that decade as map points from their original city
* Map is fully interactive, and pins are clickable for more information on each band and location

### Coming Features

* Enable map clusterer for grouping larger numbers of pins on the map
* Switch from Google geocode to file or db based geocoding of cities which will allow much greater numbers of pins

## Built With

* jQuery
* Bourbon / Neat / Bitters
